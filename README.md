What is LPDecrypt?

LPDecrypt is my crappy software application that specializes in decrypting the contents of the book "Liber Primus." It offers a range of cipher decryption techniques such as monoalphabetic substitution cipher, polyalphabetic substitution cipher, and Caesar cipher, among others. Additionally, LPDecrypt includes tools for cryptoanalysis, text manipulation, and permutations to aid in deciphering encrypted text.

Known Issues

Limited accuracy in general.
Limited accuracy in Cryptoanalysis.


Potential future improvements (If I feel like it. . .)

Improve accuracy in Cryptoanalysis even further.
Fix the Transposition Tab.
Further enhance the user interface (UI).
