What is LPDecrypt?

LPDecrypt is my crappy software application that specializes in decrypting the contents of the book "Liber Primus." It offers a range of cipher decryption techniques such as monoalphabetic substitution cipher, polyalphabetic substitution cipher, and Caesar cipher, among others. Additionally, LPDecrypt includes tools for cryptoanalysis, text manipulation, and permutations to aid in deciphering encrypted text.

Known Issues

There are key wrapping issues when using the Decrypt button with the Caesar cipher shift, which can impact the accuracy of decryption. Limited accuracy in Cryptoanalysis. Missing rune in Cryptoanalysis (potentially). The use of numbers and special characters with a key is currently prohibited.

Potential future improvements (If I feel like it. . .)

Fix key wrapping issues when using the Decrypt button with the Caesar cipher shift.
Improve accuracy in Cryptoanalysis.
Enable the ues of numbers and special characters with Vigen√®re Cipher.
Fix the Transposition Tab.
Further enhance the user interface (UI).
