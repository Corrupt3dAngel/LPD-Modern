What is LPDecrypt?

LPDecrypt is my crappy software application that specializes in decrypting the contents of the book "Liber Primus." It offers a range of cipher decryption techniques such as monoalphabetic substitution cipher, polyalphabetic substitution cipher, and Caesar cipher, among others. Additionally, LPDecrypt includes tools for cryptoanalysis, text manipulation, and permutations to aid in deciphering encrypted text.

Known Issues

There are key wrapping issues when using the Decrypt button with the Caesar cipher shift, which can impact the accuracy of decryption. Limited accuracy in Cryptoanalysis. Missing rune in Cryptoanalysis (potentially). The use of numbers and special characters with a key is currently prohibited.

Miscellaneous

Although the new Application was created in a relatively short timeframe of about 6-7 hours, there is always room for improvement. However, it is still a significant upgrade from the original application and is more visually appealing.
